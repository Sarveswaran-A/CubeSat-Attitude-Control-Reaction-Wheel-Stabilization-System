# CubeSat ADCS Demo 🚀

This repository presents a **low-cost CubeSat Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)** prototype developed using ESP32, IMU sensors, actuator-based stabilization, and a real-time web-based ground station.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) is a critical subsystem of a CubeSat responsible for:
- Determining satellite orientation
- Stabilizing orientation against disturbances
- Providing real-time telemetry to a ground station

This project demonstrates these concepts using affordable hardware and open-source tools.
